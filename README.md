## Description

B-Amazon is an Amazon-like storefront that uses MySQL and node to take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. In the 'Customer View' this application will first display all of the items available for sale and will then prompt the user to select a product they would like to buy and the quantity and will then show the user the total amount for their purchases. The quantity will be updated in the MySQL database. 

In the 'Manager View', the user will be able to view all products for sale, view products that are low on inventory, add inventory to any products, and add a completely new product.
